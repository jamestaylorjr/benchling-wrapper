You can simply zip these files and drag it on to the nwjs.exe from the nw.js website or compile it yourself (https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/how-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps or https://github.com/nwjs-community/nw-builder).  Optionally, for every major change, I will update the executable in the releases section of this project. I use nw-builder to build the windows releases.
